# Keyring

***Warning*** - This library is new and changing rapidly.

Keyring is a collection of javascript libraries for working with Bitcoin(BSV) transactions and wallets.

## Libraries

[BSV](https://github.com/BitbossIO/keyring/tree/master/packages/bsv) - The BSV library loads the most commonly needed modules to get you started working with the BSV chain.

[Transaction](https://github.com/BitbossIO/keyring/tree/master/packages/transaction) - The Transaction library handles transaction parsing, creation, signing, and more.

[Util](https://github.com/BitbossIO/keyring/tree/master/packages/util) - The Util package contains helpers shared by the other libraries.

## Contributing

All contributions of code, feedback, and feature requests are welcome. We will be using github issues to track work and will monitor it closely. Right now keyring is bare bones, but we have a nice base to build the dev tools bitcoin needs.
